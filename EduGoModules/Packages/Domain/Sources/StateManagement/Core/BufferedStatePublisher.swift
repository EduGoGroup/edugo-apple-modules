/// A thread-safe actor that publishes state updates with configurable buffering.
///
/// BufferedStatePublisher extends the StatePublisher pattern with pluggable
/// buffering strategies, allowing fine-grained control over backpressure behavior.
///
/// # Buffering Strategies
/// - `UnboundedBuffer`: No limit (default, matches StatePublisher behavior)
/// - `BoundedBuffer`: Fixed capacity, suspends producer when full
/// - `DroppingBuffer`: Fixed capacity, drops oldest elements when full
///
/// # Thread Safety
/// All state mutations and emissions are actor-isolated, ensuring thread-safe
/// access from any concurrent context.
///
/// # Example
/// ```swift
/// // Create with bounded buffer for backpressure
/// let publisher = BufferedStatePublisher<UploadState>(
///     buffer: BoundedBuffer(capacity: 10)
/// )
///
/// // Producer (may suspend if buffer full)
/// await publisher.send(UploadState(progress: 0.5))
///
/// // Consumer
/// for await state in await publisher.stream {
///     updateUI(with: state)
/// }
/// ```
